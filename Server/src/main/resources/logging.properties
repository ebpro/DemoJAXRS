# Global logging properties.

# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup.
# Comma-separated list of class names.
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.)

# Default global logging level.
# Loggers and Handlers may override this level

# Loggers
# ------------------------------------------
# Loggers are usually attached to packages.
# Here, the level for each package is specified.
# The global level is used by default, so levels
# specified here simply act as an override.

# --- ConsoleHandler ---
# Override of global logging level
